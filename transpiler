Transpilers ,source-to-source compilers, are tools that read source code written in one programming language, and produce the equivalent code in another language. Languages you write that transpile to JavaScript are often called compile-to-JS languages, and are said to target JavaScript.
Allow us to write compile-to-JavaScript languages, like CoffeeScript, TypeScript, or ClojureScript;
Let us use new and potential JavaScript features, reliably; and
Contribute to the development of the ECMAScript specification.
