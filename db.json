        "description":"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare is half prequel, half reboot to the Modern Warfare franchise.The game takes place before the events of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but since this is a re-imagining of the entire story, developer Infinity Ward still has plenty of room to not simply revisit the events of those earlier games, but alter and expand upon them however  they see fit. Itâ€™s also a return to a more grounded, realistic military shooter after years of futuristic entries"
